Internship Project

CodSoft Python Programming InternshipThis repository contains the projects completed as part of the CodSoft Python Programming Internship. The tasks focus on building foundational command-line applications to demonstrate core Python skills.
Task 1: To-Do List ApplicationA simple, command-line application for managing a list of tasks. This project was an excellent exercise in using basic data structures and functions to build a functional and interactive program.Features:Add Task: Allows the user to add new tasks to the list.View Tasks: Displays all current tasks with their corresponding index number.Delete Task: Enables the user to remove a task from the list by its index.Skills Demonstrated:FunctionsListswhile and for loopsConditional statements (if/elif/else)Basic error handling with try/except blocksHow to Run:python updated_To_Do_list.py

Task 2: Simple CalculatorA command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project helped in practicing user input handling and conditional logic to direct the program's flow.Features:Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.User-friendly menu for selecting an operation.Takes two numeric inputs from the user.Skills Demonstrated:User input with input()if/elif/else statementsType casting (int())How to Run:python calculator_Updated.py

Task 3: Password GeneratorA utility that generates a strong, randomized password based on the user's specifications for length and character types.Features:Generates passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.Customizable password length.Uses randomization to create secure and unpredictable passwords.Skills Demonstrated:The random module (e.g., random.choice(), random.shuffle())Lists and stringsLoops for character generationUser inputHow to Run:python password_generator.py

Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors GameAn interactive command-line game where the user plays against the computer. This project was a fun way to practice game logic and user interaction.Features:Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors gameplay.The computer's move is chosen randomly.Clearly displays the winner of each round.Skills Demonstrated:Conditional statements to implement game rulesThe random module to simulate the computer's choiceUser input and string manipulation (.lower(), .strip())How to Run:python Rock_paper_scisser_game.py
